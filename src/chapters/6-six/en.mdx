# 06. Friends

Imagine that you've decided to climb to the top of a mountain. It's quite difficult to pinpoint the
exact moment when the flat plain ends and the ascent begins. Most likely you'll start on a gentle
path, walk up a hilly section, spot a few low peaks in front of you, and decide to head towards
them. You may lose your way, or these peaks may turn out to not be as huge as you'd initially
thought and you'll find yourself back at the bottom again. Or maybe you'll take the right route. The
trail will get steeper and steeper, each step harder than the last.

Every hill, even the smallest one, has a {<TV video="lEsW829zNTs" from="0:26">top</TV>}. After all,
if you think about it, a mountain wouldn't be called a mountain if it didn't have an end. Perhaps
this type of obvious, simple metaphor could be used to describe the business we created with our
friends. In fact, I don't think that comparison is completely out of place here. But perhaps I am
romanticising it all too much and trying to make sense of what we were doing.

Anyway... Our modular-house-production business was going better than we could have imagined. We
were so enthusiastic about the process that the time we spent together just flew by. Our success had
its price, however. At times we felt extra pressure from our satisfied clients or acquaintances who
felt that we should seize the moment and expand the team to a really
{<TV video="Hhy7JUinlu0" from="0:03">unbelievable size</TV>}. Someone even tried to instil in us the
idea that our ultimate goal should be to ensure that every second house in the area was produced by
'Domik Limited.'

During one of our regular tea parties, we agreed that anyone would be able to bow out of the project
and switch to something else if they felt comfortable doing so, and that their choice should be
supported by the rest of us.

So when Ash was offered a position on the other side of the continent lecturing in a two-year course
at a {<TV video="-7OE6bDfM2M" from="0:07">prestigious school</TV>} specialising in 'production
technology for highly complex industrial cakes,' we were delighted for him. Until he ran it by us,
he'd had his doubts, but we were able to convince him it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Ash got behind the wheel of the very car that we'd started our journey in. It had suffered a lot of
wear and tear and the backseat had been converted into a sawdust-covered toolbox. I'd keyed in some
coordinates in his compass — given Ash's driving style, a little extra caution wouldn't go amiss.

“Don't forget about us, will you?” Evie said sadly.

“Don't worry, they'll probably kick me out in a month anyway. I'm not much of an expert on the
subject and you know I'm not very good at organising myself...”

“Well, by the time you get back, we'll have a list of the most interesting tasks prepared for you:
cleaning up sawdust, dismantling the material dump and unloading concrete blocks!” Of course, I knew
he wouldn't get kicked out. Sure, Ash was prone to having some muddled thoughts at times, but he
definitely had a talent for explaining complicated things in
{<TV video="SmjVqDdF6fk" from="0:04">simple language</TV>} and finding out-of-the-box solutions.

”See you around, mate!”

At first, Ash sent us letters every week. He would tell us about his everyday life at the institute,
about some nonsense and problems, sometimes attaching diagrams and sketches of projects he was
working on. Everything was conveyed his own narrative style, of course. His first letter: ”I made it
here. It's evening. I've been given the keys to the staff house. There's no blanket here, so I'll
just use a box.”

The next time he wrote, ”Bought a blanket. Gave the first lecture, and felt stressed out. The
students can't stop being weirdly polite to me. They also won't laugh at my jokes.” A few weeks
later he wrote: ”I've been working on my jokes. I think I've broken the ice. Purely out of habit I
built myself a sofa from scratch in the workshop…. no more boxes!”

In return emails, we would report on how many tea bags had been drunk at meetings, and sometimes
share important news and events. For example, how Phil had decided to spend more time outdoors, lead
a healthy lifestyle and {<TV video="xR7XMkjDGw0" from="1:38">write books</TV>}. However he still
advised 'Domik Limited' on the sustainable delivery of materials and recycling. Evie and Ruby
continued to develop the project with passion: they came up with the idea of extending the range by
offering modular saunas. Options like: steam pressure, the layout of the pools and the passageways
between them were configured for each client.

At some point I started to think about moving closer to the neighbouring town. I definitely liked
spending time in the workshop, but sometimes I got bored and wanted a change of scene. Also, I knew
there were more opportunities in town to try my hand at different fields or learn from local
craftspeople. Ruby and Evie supported my idea, and offered to help design a house for me to move
into before I went. They developed a unique design out of components unavailable to other clients.
Together we came up with the layout of a garden, combined with a work area in which we placed
portable boards for drawing and prototyping inventions. I'd always wanted to learn how to make
useful gadgets, like an appliance to automatically {<TV video="KVdqwD_bcPs" from="1:23">cook
eggs</TV>}, the idea for which occurred to me accidentally during a tea party.

Moving and building were taking up all my free time, and emails — both sent and received — started
to become a lot less frequent. There was so much going on that sometimes it was hard to stick to the
old schedule and put pen to paper once a week. We did not stop communicating — on the contrary, we
managed to keep in touch from time-to-time, sometimes with short messages and occasionally with
long, action-packed letters in which we shared all latest news.

Having moved into a new house, and after spending countless days in the garden honing my inventions,
I finally decided to open a modest shop to sell my {<TV video="Yj7XA3tiGUg">creations</TV>}. My
inventions did not exactly fly off the shelves, and at some points I felt like I'd failed and should
try my hand at something else. In the end, I did manage to find a small group of interested buyers
(the best selling product was manual cannons for the rapid planting of bushes — luckily there was an
active community of gardeners in town). I only spent a few days a week at the shop. The rest of the
time I spent improving and working on new inventions.

When the summer holidays came, all the members of the original team were able to meet up again. Ash
came to visit us while we were on holiday. On this occasion, Phil had devised a 'detox' programme
for us: we left our compasses behind and went on a mountain expedition (now feeling relaxed enough
to have energy for socialising). We studied plants from a guidebook prepared by Phil, made up
stories, looked at the stars and remembered the ridiculous mistakes we'd made while working on the
modular houses. We tried to {<Emotion feeling="happiness"> to appreciate every moment</Emotion>},
knowing that soon everyone would have to go back to their regular lives.

          I'd kept the habit of occasionally taking the compass out of my pocket, twirling it around
          it in my hands and studying the dial. This model was already noticeably outdated, but now
          I was only interested in its one simple function: to remind me that somewhere, where the
          arrow was pointing, my friends were waiting for me.
