# 01. The First Meeting

Everyone says that life goes by slower when you're a child. Every day is filled with the discovery
of unique sensations that we've never experienced before. But with time, everything inevitably picks
up speed. We start to get used to a routine, and almost before we know it, the world has become
monotonous. In my case, there was no perceptible acceleration — I was as if I just blinked, leaving
my eyes closed a little longer as usual... and WHOOSH here I am now in the present, not sure what
I'm doing with my life. Someday I hope to invent a device that prohibits blinking at least
{<TV video="-01-XBHXFq8">once every 3 seconds</TV>}.

I took my compass out of my pocket. There used to be a sort of ritual associated with it. I had a
dedicated compartment in my belt bag, and in this compartment was a special pouch covered with shiny
metal that I stored the compass in. I would sometimes spend hours taking in every detail of this
intriguing object. Sometimes I even deliberately stashed it back in the bag, just in order to be
able to rediscover it another time.

It had taken quite some doing to get my hands on this compass. No one else seemed to have such an
advanced model. It had a huge, detailed scale, a mirror through which you could send signals to your
acquaintances, plus a side button that started the timer. I'm sure it contained other useful
features that I had never even used. <Gem oct={3} />

But now the compass didn't arouse any feelings in me whatsoever…. it was something that I
unthinkingly took out and stuffed back in my pocket. I also started storing it with less care: it
often fell out of my hand and remained forgotten in the most unpleasant places. What a stupid thing…

“What do you think they'll add in the new versions?”

“Huh?”

“What's he doing here? And who is he anyway? I'm definitely not in the mood for a chat right now”

“Your model's not bad. Mine is just as good of course,” boasted the stranger. “It's in good working
order, although I haven't been using it much lately.”

”Well if he says so,” I thought to myself. “Frankly it's hard to imagine _that piece of junk_ in his
hands being operational.” And then I said out loud: “To be honest, I don't really feel like talking
with anyone right now.”

”Oh, there's no need to talk! Jump in… we can drive in silence for a few hours. I'm sure we'll come
up with a good topic for a conversation after that.”

My conversation partner pointed to a rusty car without wheels and a thick rubber strip around it. It
was the same kind you can see at an amusement park — the strip acts as a sort of bumper, so that
when you hit another car, everything stays together, even if the crash gives you quite a jolt. The
car was designed for two people, and the driver and passenger were crammed in right next to each
other.

“There's a to-do list that I need help ticking off” said my companion, already jumping into the car.
He gestured for me to join him. <Gem oct={0} /> “Let's go?”

There are moments in life when you are on the verge of taking a risk. For example you've clambered
all the way up to the highest diving platform at the swimming pool, but you don't dare jump. You
think to yourself “I'd better turn back before it's too late!” But you just need to take one step
forward, and in a split second that thought won't bother you at all.

I decided to risk it: “OK, but only if we use my compass for directions.”

“Sounds great. My name's Ash by the way.”

”And I'm Kay.”
